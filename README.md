# ClickBait Detection
#### You won't believe what this group in DS 310 did to get an insanely high F-Score!

## Repository Setup
1. Create new folder, `Data`, under the root directory of the repository.
2. Download dataset from DS 310 website and recursively unzip all files such
that it follows the following structure.

        /Data
            |- dataset/
            |- dataset_no_figures/
            |- sample_train.arff

## Target Work Schedule
The following schedule is a rough estimate of what we should be doing.
There may or may not be deviances from this depending on how things go.
This is just a rough estimate:

| Dates       | Task                                                                                    |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 9/22 - 9/24 | Literature Review and EDA + Feature Exploration                                         |
| 9/25 - 9/29 | Individually construct various models based on literature and other available features. |
| 9/30 - 10/2 | Build Ensemble Models                                                                   |
| 10/4        | All modeling should be done at this point.                                              |
| 10/4 - 10/8 | Complete paper write up.                                                                |
